# 🧠Brain-Controlled Monopoly Bot

Play Monopoly using only your **brain signals**! This project uses SSVEP (Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential) brain-computer interface technology to control an automated Monopoly bot through EEG signals, allowing completely hands-free gameplay.

## 🧠 Overview

This groundbreaking system combines brain-computer interface (BCI) technology with game automation to play Monopoly using nothing but your thoughts. By focusing on flickering visual stimuli at different frequencies (7Hz, 9.5Hz, and 12Hz), users generate detectable brain signals that are classified using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to issue game commands.

The system records EEG data via BrainFlow (supporting OpenBCI Cyton/Ganglion boards), analyzes SSVEP responses in real-time, and translates them into Monopoly actions like rolling dice, buying properties, bidding on auctions, and making strategic decisions—all without touching a keyboard or mouse!

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pbhutia111/monopoly-with-brain-signals-SSVEP-.git
cd monopoly-with-brain-signals-SSVEP-
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install Tesseract OCR:
```bash
# macOS
brew install tesseract

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

# Windows - download installer from:
# https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Option 1: Full BCI Control (Requires EEG Hardware)

Run the complete brain-controlled Monopoly bot:

```bash
# With OpenBCI Ganglion
python psy.py

# With OpenBCI Cyton
python ssvep_experiment.py run --board cyton --serial /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXX --freqs 7 9.5 12 --trial-sec 10 --reps 2

# Testing with synthetic data (no hardware)
python ssvep_experiment.py run --board synthetic --freqs 7 9.5 12 --trial-sec 10 --reps 2
```

**How it works:**
1. Focus on Arc browser with Monopoly game open
2. Look at flickering boxes to generate SSVEP signals
3. System detects your brain signals and executes game actions
4. Commands are formed from 2 trials × 3 frequencies = 9 possible actions

### Option 2: Keyboard Control (No EEG Required)

Test the automation with keyboard controls:

```bash
python auto.py
```

**Controls:**
- **`L` key**: Confirm actions (roll, buy, OK, end turn)
- **`K` key**: Accept/Bid
- **`L` key**: Reject/Fold

### Option 3: Pong SSVEP Demo

Test SSVEP stimulus with a simple Pong game:

```bash
python pong.py
```

**Controls:**
- **Top Paddle**: `A` (left) / `D` (right)
- **Bottom Paddle**: `←` (left) / `→` (right)
- **Exit**: `ESC`

## 🧬 How It Works

### 1. SSVEP Signal Generation
The system displays flickering boxes at three distinct frequencies:
- **7.0 Hz** → Command "a"
- **9.5 Hz** → Command "b"  
- **12.0 Hz** → Command "c"

### 2. Brain Signal Detection
When you focus on a flickering box, your visual cortex generates electrical activity at the same frequency. This SSVEP response is recorded via EEG electrodes (4-channel OpenBCI setup).

### 3. Signal Processing Pipeline
```
Raw EEG → Bandpass Filter (5.5-15Hz) → Notch Filter (60Hz) → 
Sliding Windows (1s) → FFT Analysis → Power Spectrum Extraction
```

### 4. CCA Classification
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) compares recorded signals with reference sine/cosine waves at target frequencies to determine which frequency you're focusing on.

### 5. Command Mapping
Two consecutive trials create a 2-character command (e.g., "ab", "ca", "bb"):

| Command | Action | Usage |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `aa` | Start Game | Begin new game |
| `ab` | Roll Dice | Roll on your turn |
| `ac` | OK/Confirm | Acknowledge cards/events |
| `ba` | Buy Property | Purchase property |
| `bb` | Pay Jail | Pay $50 to exit jail |
| `bc` | Bid | Place bid in auction |
| `ca` | Fold | Skip auction |
| `cb` | Reject | Decline trade offer |
| `cc` | Accept | Accept trade offer |

### 6. Game Automation
- **OCR Detection**: Reads game state from screen
- **State Machine**: Tracks player/bot turns
- **PyAutoGUI**: Executes mouse clicks at detected UI elements

## 🎮 Game State Machine

The bot operates as a finite state machine:

```
START → PLAYER TURN → [Roll → Buy/OK/Jail] → End Turn → BOT TURN → [Wait/Bid/Accept] → PLAYER TURN
```

**Player State:**
- Detect prompt (roll dice or jail)
- Execute action via BCI
- Handle post-roll events (buy, chance/community chest)
- End turn

**Bot State:**  
- Monitor for bid/fold or accept/reject prompts
- Respond via BCI when player input required
- Transition to player turn when bot finishes
